# Hello üëã

Full Stack Software Engineer and AI Engineer | Generalist | Former Air Force Officer

## About Me

I'm a versatile engineer who thrives at the intersection of traditional software development and emerging AI technologies. As a generalist, I enjoy tackling challenges across the entire stack - from system architecture to user interfaces, from data pipelines to machine learning models.

My background as an Air Force Officer instilled in me a systematic approach to problem-solving and a deep appreciation for reliable, mission-critical systems. I bring this same discipline to software engineering while embracing the rapid innovation cycles of the tech industry.

## üîç Current Focus

- Building AI agents that augment human capabilities
- Developing robust full-stack applications with AI at their core
- Creating seamless integrations between traditional software and LLMs
- Exploring RAG systems and advanced prompt engineering techniques
- Architecting scalable solutions for complex data challenges

## üí° Engineering Philosophy

I believe great software comes from:
- **Systems thinking** - Understanding how components interact at scale
- **Pragmatic solutions** - Choosing the right tool for the job, not the newest
- **Continuous learning** - Technology evolves; so should we
- **First principles** - Question assumptions, build from fundamentals

## üõ†Ô∏è Approach

As a generalist, I adapt to whatever the problem requires. Whether it's optimizing backend performance, crafting intuitive frontends, or implementing AI solutions, I focus on delivering value through well-engineered systems.

## üìö Always Learning

Currently deepening my expertise in AI agent architectures, distributed systems, and the evolving landscape of human-AI collaboration.

## üí¨ Let's Connect

I enjoy discussing software architecture, AI applications, and the future of technology. Feel free to reach out for collaboration or technical discussions.
